A fully decentralized P2P SOL-to-INR exchange platform with zero-trust architecture and no central arbitrator.
Users can recharge their SOL wallets by depositing funds into a shared SOL liquidity pool. For INR-to-SOL conversions, the platform uses dynamic QR codes with automated pay-in verificationâ€”instantly crediting SOL upon successful INR detection.

SOL-to-INR conversions are handled by independent payout nodes hosted by verified users. These nodes automate INR disbursements and earn yield through a stake in the pool. Each node is fully encrypted, obfuscated, and protected using SAPI (Secure Application Protocol Interface), ensuring the hosting logic cannot be tampered with or reverse-engineered.

In the event of third-party API or banking failures, node operators can securely report incidents and trigger transparent refund mechanisms for their stake, maintaining trustless fault tolerance without any centralized arbitration.
