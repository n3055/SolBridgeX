# 🔁 Decentralized P2P SOL ↔ INR Exchange

A fully decentralized, trustless, and censorship-resistant P2P exchange platform that allows users to seamlessly convert SOL to INR and vice versa—without relying on any central authority or arbitrator.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized SOL ↔ INR Conversion**  
  No platform arbitrator or custodian—transactions are fully peer-to-peer.

- **SOL Recharge via Liquidity Pool**  
  Users can top up their SOL wallets by depositing INR through verified pay-ins. SOL is credited directly from a shared liquidity pool.

- **Dynamic QR-Based INR Pay-ins**  
  INR-to-SOL conversions use real-time QR code generation and automated payment verification.

- **Automated INR Payouts by Nodes**  
  Users can convert SOL to INR by triggering automated payouts handled by distributed nodes.

- **Stake-Driven Node Participation**  
  Anyone can host a secure node by staking SOL into the shared pool. In return, they earn a share of transaction fees.

- **Fully Encrypted & Obfuscated Nodes**  
  Nodes are built with full encryption, binary obfuscation, and utilize **SAPI (Secure Application Protocol Interface)** to prevent tampering or reverse engineering.

- **Trustless Refund Mechanism**  
  In the event of third-party API or payment rail failures, nodes can report issues and trigger verified refund requests of their stake.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **INR → SOL (Pay-in Flow)**  
   - User initiates a pay-in request.  
   - Dynamic UPI QR is generated.  
   - Payment is verified automatically.  
   - SOL is released from the pool to user's wallet.

2. **SOL → INR (Payout Flow)**  
   - User initiates a payout request.  
   - A node detects the request and automates INR transfer to the user's bank.  
   - Node earns transaction fee share based on its stake.

3. **Node Hosting**  
   - Host a node by staking SOL.  
   - Your node automates INR payouts and earns proportional rewards.  
   - All logic is encrypted and handled via secure SAPI interface.  
   - Stake refunds are possible in failure scenarios.
